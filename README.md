This is a team  project for Biostatistics course.
Our main objective in this project is to reach to the best performance out of the dataset as we face a great challenge in preprocessing stage as we have too much data and we tried to select the best of it to reach to the best output in classifying different types of cancer disease. and we have to choose the best model that visualize this data , so we will used different models and select the  three model that obtain the best performance which are Decision Tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes models.
